    <p>
      Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, is home to 21 million people. In low-income areas such as the Apapa neighbourhood, people do not always have access to fresh produce and fruits, which are vital for a balanced diet. As a result, malnutritions is common among Lagosâ€™ poorer citizens.
      <br><br>
      WeSprout is a low-tech hydroponics starter kit that empowers low-income households in Lagos to grow leafy greens and vegetables in their home.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Financing WeSprout</h3>
    <p>
      Giving out hydroponics starter kits in Lagos does not come cheap. To finance the WeSprout initiative, we came up with two sources of revenue. First, the WeSprout starter kit is available for retail in Germany. For each starter kit sold in Germany, we donate one starter kit to a person in need in Lagos. Second, we provide the WeSprout app - an online community platform for all-things hydroponics.
