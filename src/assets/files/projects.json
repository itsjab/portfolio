      "description": "Food waste is a common problem in restaurants around the world. During my undergraduate studies I worked as a cook in restaurants in Germany and the US. Despite careful planning, we often had to throw away edible food at the end of the night.\n\nFor my master thesis at the Queensland University of Technology, I collaborated with chefs in Brisbane and Melbourne to find solutions for food waste in the restaurant industry. The result is Fino, a digital tool that simplifies the procurement process.",

The app containes information about the three weekends covering the topics democracy, power, and participation.\n\nWhile designing and building the app, we tried to capture the unadjusted atmosphere of the festival and its artists.",

That's why we think, the bike is the perfect vehicle for incoming refugees to explore beautiful Munich.\n\nSince October 2014 we setup our mobile repair workshop in refugee homes across Munich. What started as a student project, turned into monthly workshops and collaborations with organizations from Munich and all over Germany.\n\nCreating and monitoring the website for SocialRide is both challenging and rewarding. I can use the skills learned at the LMU to help refugees get a head start here in Munich. Most importantly I can work with a great team on hip bicycles.",
