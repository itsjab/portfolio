The app containes information about the three weekends covering the topics democracy, power, and participation.\n\nWhile designing and building the app, we tried to capture the unadjusted atmosphere of the festival and its artists.",

That's why we think, the bike is the perfect vehicle for incoming refugees to explore the beautiful Munich.\n\nSince October 2014 we setup our bike workshop in multiple refugee homes giving out free bikes and services. Recently we started offering a new service called Pimp My Bike where we refurbish and sell old bikes together with refugees.\n\nCreating and monitoring the website for SocialRide is both challenging and rewarding. I can use the skills learned at the LMU to help refugees get a head start here in Munich. And most importantly I can work with a great team on hip bicycles.",
